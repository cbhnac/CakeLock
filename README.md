# **CakeLock**

Are you tired of forgetting to lock your PC when leaving it, potentially letting your colleagues send department wide cake mails?
CakeLock solves the problem for you! 

It uses a webcam to detect if any face is present for approximately 15 seconds, and if no face has been present it locks the machine.
During the lock it stops checking for faces, and when the PC is unlocked it starts up again.

For DlibDotNet to work in Visual Studio the application must run in a x64 configuration.
